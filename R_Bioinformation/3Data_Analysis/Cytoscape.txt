Network representation and analysis
The filtered dataset on adj p.value < 0.07 was uploaded on STRING to generate a network. The network was then imported in Cytoscape (v3.8.1) and analyzed with stringApp (v1.6.0). Subcellular compartments were assigned by filtration in stringApp. Maps representing enrichments at different time-points were plotted by using the Hierarchical Clustering function in clusterMaker.
